			IMLS is your chance to build your network and learn from other leaders. Our programs are based around emerging industry topics and we use attendee feedback to optimize every event. Additionally, as an invite-only event, there are no vendors, only marketers. Our goal is to make sure you’re getting the most out of your time with us.

						This event is much more interactive than other events. There is a lot of teamwork, a lot of team building, there’s a lot of presenting your own business plan and your own case studies, so it’s interesting to see how all these companies that are cross industry and cross segments really have a lot of similarities when it comes down to it, in terms of marketing mix.
